# Veterinary
The system we developed is intended for the management of a veterinary clinic.
The system will do this by managing customer animal information. Managing medication inventory at the clinic, and setting dates for treatments and appointments for the animals.
The management system will be able to work in veterinary clinics so that the monitoring of the animals will be more orderly, there will be a faster access for data, medical monitoring of the animals will be performed and with the help of these things we will be able to save manpower.
The system has two connection options, one option as a veterinarian, a second option as a clinic client.
